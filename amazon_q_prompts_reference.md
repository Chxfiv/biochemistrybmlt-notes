# Amazon Q Prompts Reference Guide
## For Biochemistry Presentation

### How to Use These Prompts

#### Option 1: Live Demonstration
1. Open Amazon Q in a separate browser tab/window
2. When you reach a slide with a prompt, read it aloud
3. Copy-paste the exact prompt into Amazon Q
4. Show the live response to your audience
5. Discuss the answer and encourage questions

#### Option 2: Pre-prepared Screenshots
1. Run all prompts beforehand
2. Take screenshots of the best responses
3. Insert screenshots next to prompt boxes on slides
4. Works without internet during presentation

## The 6 Strategic Amazon Q Prompts

### Prompt 1 (Slide 4): Carbohydrate Stereochemistry
**Prompt:** "Can you explain the clinical significance of D-glucose vs. L-glucose in human metabolism?"

**Why This Works:** 
- Moves beyond basic definitions to clinical application
- Demonstrates why molecular structure matters in medicine
- Connects chemistry to patient care

**Expected Response Topics:**
- Only D-glucose is metabolically active
- Enzyme specificity for D-forms
- L-glucose as potential artificial sweetener
- Evolutionary biochemistry

---

### Prompt 2 (Slide 6): Laboratory Differentiation
**Prompt:** "Design a simple lab protocol to differentiate between sucrose, lactose, and maltose in unknown solutions."

**Why This Works:**
- Directly connects theory to lab practice
- Essential skill for BMLT students
- Demonstrates practical problem-solving

**Expected Response Topics:**
- Benedict's test for reducing sugars
- Barfoed's test specificity
- Enzyme-specific assays (invertase, lactase, maltase)
- Chromatography methods

---

### Prompt 3 (Slide 8): Clinical Correlation
**Prompt:** "Compare and contrast the laboratory findings for a patient with Diabetes Mellitus and a patient with Lactose Intolerance."

**Why This Works:**
- Synthesizes carbohydrate knowledge
- Shows differential diagnosis process
- Highlights BMLT role in patient care

**Expected Response Topics:**
- Blood glucose levels
- Urine tests (glucose, ketones)
- Breath hydrogen test
- Symptom correlation with lab values

---

### Prompt 4 (Slide 12): Structure-Function Relationship
**Prompt:** "Using the example of sickle cell anemia, explain how a change in primary structure affects all subsequent levels of protein structure and leads to disease."

**Why This Works:**
- Classic example of protein biochemistry
- Shows cascade effect of molecular changes
- Connects genetics to pathophysiology

**Expected Response Topics:**
- Single amino acid substitution (Gluâ†’Val)
- Altered protein folding and aggregation
- Changed cell shape and function
- Clinical manifestations

---

### Prompt 5 (Slide 13): Laboratory Applications
**Prompt:** "List common reagents used in a clinical lab that can cause protein denaturation and explain how this principle is used in diagnostic tests."

**Why This Works:**
- Links chemical principles to lab procedures
- Shows practical applications of denaturation
- Relevant to daily BMLT work

**Expected Response Topics:**
- Trichloroacetic acid (protein precipitation)
- Heat denaturation in coagulation studies
- Urea in electrophoresis
- Detergents in cell lysis

---

### Prompt 6 (Slide 15): Clinical Interpretation
**Prompt:** "Interpret a hypothetical serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) report showing a low albumin peak and a large, broad peak in the gamma region."

**Why This Works:**
- Simulates real diagnostic scenario
- Tests interpretation skills
- Shows clinical decision-making process

**Expected Response Topics:**
- Hypoalbuminemia causes (liver disease, malnutrition)
- Polyclonal gammopathy (chronic inflammation)
- Differential diagnosis considerations
- Follow-up testing recommendations

---

### Final Meta-Prompt (Slide 16): AI in Healthcare
**Prompt:** "What are the potential benefits and limitations of using AI assistants like you in a medical laboratory setting?"

**Why This Works:**
- Encourages critical thinking about technology
- Addresses ethical considerations
- Prepares students for AI-integrated future

**Expected Response Topics:**
- Benefits: Speed, consistency, knowledge access
- Limitations: Need for validation, human oversight
- Ethical considerations in patient care
- Future of AI-human collaboration

## Presentation Tips

### Engaging Your Audience
1. **Ask for predictions:** Before running a prompt, ask audience what they think Amazon Q will say
2. **Encourage questions:** After each response, ask if anyone wants clarification
3. **Make it interactive:** Have students suggest their own prompts
4. **Connect to experience:** Relate responses to lab experiences or case studies

### Technical Considerations
- Test all prompts beforehand to ensure good responses
- Have backup screenshots in case of technical issues
- Practice smooth transitions between slides and Amazon Q
- Consider having a co-presenter manage the Amazon Q interface

### Follow-up Activities
- Provide students with the prompt list for self-study
- Encourage them to create their own biochemistry prompts
- Use Amazon Q for homework help and exam preparation
- Integrate into lab report writing and case study analysis
