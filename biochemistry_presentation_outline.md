## Presentation Tips:

### Live Demonstration Approach:
1. Have Amazon Q interface open in a separate window
2. Read prompts aloud during presentation
3. Execute queries live to show real-time responses
4. Engage audience with interactive Q&A

### Pre-prepared Approach:
1. Run all Amazon Q queries beforehand
2. Take screenshots of best responses
3. Include screenshots next to prompts on slides
4. Works without internet connection during presentation

### Visual Design Recommendations:
- Use consistent color scheme (blue/green for biochemistry theme)
- Include molecular structure diagrams
- Use Amazon Q logo/branding for prompt boxes
- Add icons for different biomolecule types
- Include lab equipment imagery for BMLT context
